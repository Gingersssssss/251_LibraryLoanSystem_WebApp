# CS251: Library Book Borrowing & Returning System (Database-Driven Web Application)

## Project Overview
  This project was the final assignment for CS251 (Database I), developed collaboratively with a team of 10 members over a duration of one month.
  The system was developed as a web application, incorporating fundamental features to support a library's book borrowing and returning services.

## Functional Component Design 
- **Book Search**: Allows users to search for books available in the database (**Roles: Administrator, User**).  
- **Book Cart**: Enables users to collect books they intend to borrow (**Role: User**).  
- **Borrowing & Returning System**: Manages the borrowing and returning process, including tracking the status of transactions (**Role: Administrator, User**).  
- **Book Recommendations**: Suggests popular books based on borrowing statistics (**Role: User**).  
- **Book Management**: Enables administrators to add and remove books from the system (**Role: Administrator**).

## Database Component Design 
  The database structure was designed based on the Enhanced Entity-Relationship (EER) Model to ensure a well-organized and scalable database system.

## Technology Stack & Development Tools  
- **Database Management System (DBMS):** MySQL  
- **Backend Development:** Spring Boot framework, developed in IntelliJ IDEA
- **Frontend Development:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Database Design:** Draw.io  
- **UX/UI Design:** Figma
